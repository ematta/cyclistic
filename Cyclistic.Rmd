# Cyclistic

## Business Task

### Setup of Environment

```{r install}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("RSQLite")
```

## Data Sources

Our datasources can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). To download them, execute the following python script in the `etl` folder. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` then run `python downloader.py` to download all the files.

```{bash, engine.opts='-l'}
make downloads
```

Once downloaded, we will load our resulting database to our R sheet. Let's connect.

```{r database}
library(DBI)
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "cyclistic.db")
df <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM cyclistic")
dbDisconnect(con)
```
